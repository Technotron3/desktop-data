  <text intro="In the post-9/11 United States, many airlines had trouble getting their passenger values back up to normal. As the CEO of jetBlue, your job is to revitalize the airline market for the New York Metropolitan area, one of the busiest airspaces in the world. You will have 5 years to grow to a fleet of at least 50 aircraft, serving at least 25 domestic and 5 international destinations. During that time, you must have a 5% passenger growth every year, and keep your bank account in the black. Good luck, we know you've got what it takes!"/>
  <text success="Congratulations! You have successfully improved and revitalized the commercial airline market in the United States and New York metropolitan area by maintaining constant growth and high standards of safety over the previous 5 years!"/>
